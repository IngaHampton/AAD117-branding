<img src="images/about-me.png">
    
<p id="one"><strong>Well hello there!</strong> I am Inga Hampton and welcome to my page. I currently am a first year Interaction Design Student at the University of Ulster, located in Belfast.</p>

<p id= two>I have a great interest in most aspects of creative Arts; graphical art, music, traditional art and photography. I enjoy creating wallpapers and typography. I am greatly inspired by the works of Josef Muller-Brockmann and Paul Rand. I am a lover for the flat form design as i think it can portray an image within a few simple shapes. As I am woman of little words I like to use the flat form illustrations to help express and emphasise what I am trying to put across to my audience, As I said a picture can speak a throusand words.</p>
    
<p id="three">In my spare time I enjoy playing games. I also like to draw and listen to a wide range of music. When I can, I love to go to concerts, watch comedy, travel... and the list goes on! For now keep a wee eye out, as I shall be sharing my thoughts and designs with you!</p>
    
<p id="four">Thank for reading!</p>
