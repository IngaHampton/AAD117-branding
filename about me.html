<p> HELLO THERE, I'M
INGA HAMPTON

I’m a first year Interaction Design Student, Belfast.
I currently study at the University of Ulster. I have a great interest in most aspects of creative Arts; graphical art, music, traditional art and photography. I enjoy creating wallpapers and typography. I am greatly inspired by the works of Josef Müller-Brockmann and Stefan Sagmeister.
In my spare time, I enjoy a good book and game. I also like to draw and listen to a wide range of music. When I can, I love to go to concerts, watch comedy, travel… and the list goes on!
Keep an eye out, as I shall be blogging very soon,sharing my thoughts and designs with you! But in the meantime check out some of my graphic work on Flickr, or tweet me by clicking on the Icons below!  </p>
